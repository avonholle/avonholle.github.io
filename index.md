I am a doctoral candidate in the [Department of Epidemiology at UNC, Chapel Hill](http://sph.unc.edu/epid/epidemiology-landing/). My thesis centers on early life determinants of chronic disease. In particular, I am studying the effects of early infant growth on adolescent lipid profiles in a Chilean infancy cohort.

My research work has centered around this topic, and my dissertation research as well as accompanying manuscripts have a focus on both infant growth and lipids. This web site documents the analyses for this work.
