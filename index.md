I graduated with a Ph.D. from the [Department of Epidemiology at UNC, Chapel Hill](http://sph.unc.edu/epid/epidemiology-landing/) in 2018. My thesis centered on early life determinants of chronic disease, including the effects of early infant growth on adolescent lipid profiles. This web site documents the analyses for this work with data from a Chilean infancy cohort.
